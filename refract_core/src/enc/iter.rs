///
/// If the encoder supports lossless encoding, that is attempted first, right
/// out the gate.
///
/// From there, the `Iterator` [`EncodeIter::next`] can be repeatedly called
/// to produce candidate images at various encoding qualities. Each result
/// should be expected for Quality Assurance and passed to either
/// [`EncodeIter::keep`] if it is good or [`EncodeIter::discard`] if it sucks.
///
/// Feedback from keep/discard operations is factored into the iterator,
/// allowing it to adjust the min/max quality boundaries to avoid pointless
/// operations.
///
/// Once the iterator has finished, you can collect the total computation
/// duration by calling [`EncodeIter::time`] and/or call [`EncodeIter::take`]
/// to obtain the best candidate image discovered, if any.
