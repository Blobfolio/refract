///
/// If the encoder supports lossless encoding, that is attempted first, right
/// out the gate.
///
/// From there, [`EncodeIter::advance`] can be repeatedly called to produce
/// candidate images at various encoding qualities, returning a byte slice of
/// the last encoded image so you can e.g. write it to a file.
///
/// Each result should be expected for Quality Assurance before continuing,
/// with a call to either [`EncodeIter::keep`] if it looked good or
/// [`EncodeIter::discard`] if it sucked.
///
/// Feedback from keep/discard operations is factored into the iterator,
/// allowing it to adjust the min/max quality boundaries to avoid pointless
/// operations.
///
/// Once the iterator has finished, you can collect the total computation
/// duration by calling [`EncodeIter::time`] and/or call [`EncodeIter::take`]
/// to obtain the best candidate image discovered, if any.
