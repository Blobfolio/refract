# Refract

Refract is a guided CLI image conversion tool. It takes [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) and [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) image sources and produces [AVIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1#AV1_Image_File_Format_(AVIF)), [JPEG XL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_XL), and [WebP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) clones.

The program is named after — and works like — eye doctor Refraction Tests. It generates images at various qualities, asking at each step how it looks, until it arrives at the smallest acceptable candidate possible.

The beauty of this approach is that it moots the need for exhaustive testing. Refract's quality stepping works by selecting the mid-point between moving min/max boundaries. Each answer you provide adjusts the range, allowing the final, perfect result to be discovered in just 5-10 steps instead of 100+.



## Why?

Every image is different. The idea of a "Magic Bullet" format is a myth.

If you want to truly maximize the quality and size of next-gen copies, you cannot rely on hardcoded constants or fancy [SSIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity) analysis. That will result in frequent over- or under-compression, and some images will come out looking… bad.

You have to actually use your eyes. And you have to pay attention to the resulting file sizes. Sometimes newer formats fall short of what the originals achieved.

While you can do all of this manually, running multiple programs hundreds of times for each and every source you want to convert, it is easy to screw up, and really tedious.

Refract helps makes that manual process _less_ tedious.

It automatically uses the strongest (slowest) possible compression settings for each format, keeps track of file sizes and qualities, can process inputs en masse, and reduces the number of conversion tests by around 90%.

Should you use it for every image ever? No, probably not. The next generation formats, particularly AVIF and JPEG XL, require a lot of computation to discover byte savings. All those minutes will add up quickly.

But if you're looking to obsessively optimize a small project or single web page, Refract is the way to go!



## Features

Only JPEG and PNG input sources are supported. They can have RGB, RGBA, greyscale, or greyscale w/ alpha color spaces, but CMYK is not supported.

Conversion is done at pixel level; gamma and other metadata profile information is not factored or present in the converted copies, so is not supported.

Refract implements [`libavif`](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif), [`libjxl`](https://gitlab.com/wg1/jpeg-xl), and [`libwebp`](https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libwebp/) directly so has comparable performance to each format's official standalone binaries (at similar settings). There is some nuance under-the-hood, but Refract's encoding passes roughly correspond to the following third-party commands:

| Encoding | Mode | Parallel | Comparable To Running |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | --------------------- |
| AVIF | Lossy | Y | `cavif --color rgb --speed 1 --quality <N>` |
| JPEG XL | Lossless | Y | `cjxl --speed tortoise --distance 0.0` |
| JPEG XL | Lossy | Y | `cjxl --speed tortoise --distance <N>` |
| WebP | Lossless | N | `cwebp -lossless -z 9 -q 100` |
| WebP | Lossy | N | `cwebp -m 6 -pass 10 -q <N>` |

Refract applies lossless encoding first, when supported, then follows by testing lossy compression at various qualities until the "best" overall candidate is found.

The guided feedback is only required for lossy stages. Lossless, being lossless, is assumed to be fine so long as it results in a smaller image than the source.

### AVIF

AVIF encoding is _slow_.

To make it at all bearable, two concessions are made:
 * The encoder is run with speed `1` rather than speed `0`;
 * Images are split into "tiles" that can be processed in parallel;

The latter is compensated for by automatically repeating the chosen "best" encoding one time at the end with tiling optimizations disabled.

Color sources are outputted using `Y′UV444`, while greyscale sources are outputted using `Y′UV400` instead.

Speaking of color, Refract attempts AVIF encoding using both full-range (RGB) and limited-range (YCbCr) methods. To speed up processing, you can pass the `--skip-ycbcr` flag to have Refract stick with just RGB.

**Note:**
 >The upcoming release of Chrome v.91 is introducing stricter requirements for AVIF images that will [prevent the rendering of many previously valid sources](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1115483). This will break a fuckton of images, including those created with Refract < `0.3.1`. Be sure to regenerate any such images using `0.3.1+` to avoid any sadness.



## Usage

It's easy.

Just run `refract [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <PATH(S)>…`.

The following flags are available:

```bash
-h, --help        Prints help information.
    --no-avif     Skip AVIF conversion.
    --no-jxl      Skip JPEG XL conversion.
    --no-webp     Skip WebP conversion.
    --skip-ycbcr  Only test full-range RGB AVIF encoding (when encoding AVIFs).
-V, --version     Prints version information.
```

By default, Refract will generate copies in every next-gen format. If you want to skip one, use the corresponding `--no-*` flag.

You can specify any number of input paths. The paths can be individual JPEG or PNG images, or directories containing such images. You can also/alternatively specify paths using the `-l`/`--list` option, which should point to a text file containing any number of paths, one per line.

```bash
# Handle one image.
refract /path/to/image.jpg

# Example pulling paths from a text file.
refract --list /path/to/list.txt /path/to/another/image.jpg

# Skip WebP.
refract --no-webp /path/to/image.jpg
```

Refract will load each input image one-at-a-time and try to generate proposed AVIF, JPEG XL, and/or WebP copies at varying quality levels. At each step, it will ask you whether or not the proposed image looks good.

You can preview the candidate images in any program of your choice. Whatever you're comfortable with. We like using web browsers for this.

If your answers and the file sizes work out right, a final best-case copy of each image will be created in the source directory with `.avif`, `.jxl`, or `.webp` appended to the source path, e.g. `/path/to/image.jpg.webp`.



## Installation

Pre-built `.deb` packages are added to each [release](https://github.com/Blobfolio/refract/releases/latest) for Debian and Ubuntu users (or in a Docker container, etc.).

The program is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and so can be built from source using [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) on most other x86-64 Unix platforms (Mac, etc.).

```bash
# Compile it. You can specify additional flags as desired.
cargo build --release
```

Cargo _will_ take care of the entire build for you, but your system will need modern versions of Clang, GCC, NASM, and Ninja installed to make it through `build.rs` hell. (Who would have thought kitchen sink image formats would have so many build dependencies?)
